# Multi-modal-Neural-Network-Architecture
OKC and Madison files have XGboost neural network to identify most probable sensor tags affecting production. These finsing help to pinpoint the units in whole production which should require attention to improve production, The models showed 80% accuracy and are trained on 3 year sensor data corresponding to around 500 tags for each plant. Text is extracted from web using selenium, images and bounding boxes are automated using tesseract. The goal is to train a multi modal architecture capable of learning from multi dimensional data and generate answers about production issues,machine efficiency etc
